Description:
 &amp;ldquo;Manage your content. Distribute it anywhere. The open source Headless CMS Front-End Developers love.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>In my lab I have a gateway server that is responsible for both DirectAccess and RD Gateway operations.
Since I only have one external IP, I sit behind a NAT (or two). In order to be able to do both DirectAccess (DA) and RD Gateway (RDG), I need to use the Web Application Proxy (WAP) feature from Server 2012 R2&amp;rsquo;s Remote Access role.

      <description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;re using something like DDD or Gdbinit, gdb vanilla is pretty hard to work with when reversing binaries.
The following is a bunch of display commands that gdb will execute after every &amp;lsquo;step&amp;rsquo;; put them in a file called gdb.cmd somewhere in ~/:
# cat ~/gdb.cmd set disassembly-flavor intel display/10i $eip display/x $eax display/x $ebx display/x $ecx display/x $edx display/x $edi display/x $esi display/x $ebp display/16xw $esp break main  Now you can use the -x gdb commandline parameter and running a program with start or run will show the following:</description>
