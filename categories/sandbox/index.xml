      <description>One of the things I missed after switching from VMware to Hyper-V is the ability to copy-paste files from host to guest via the interface.
The workaround for Hyper-V (at this time) is to use either RDP or SMB to transfer files. This is just fine for most configurations but for me this would not work.
I was setting a VM as a sandbox for malware analysis and therefore I would not be able to leverage network based protocols to transfer files.</description>
