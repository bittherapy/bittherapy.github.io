      <description>The other day I deployed a micro CentOS instance in Google Cloud&amp;rsquo;s Compute Engine. Normally 600mb of RAM is more than enough to do some light nginx/node.js work for me, but I ran into a bit of an issue when working with setsebool.
In order to allow nginx to proxy websockets to my upstream node.js server, I have to loosen some SELinux boolean and to make sure this change is permanent.</description>

      <title>SETroubleshoot Email Notification on SELinux Denial</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently installed setroubleshoot-server on my RHEL6 server to help diagnose various SELinux denials as I attempt to secure the box.
SETroubleshoot also has an email notification system that is really easy to implement. There are a couple of things that you should consider before going forward.
Add the recipient email addresses to /var/lib/setroubleshoot/email_alert_recipients:
admin@example.com filter_type=after_first  Note: the after_first filter will prevent setroubleshoot from flooding your inbox with the same alert.</description>

      <title>SELinuxâ€™s setroubleshoot Install on a RHEL6 Server</title>

      <description>I am planning on using RHEL6 as a web server, primarily for my Mercurial/GIT repositories. This was to replace my current Fedora13 instance. After the initial minimal install, there were a couple of things missing. Mainly setroubleshoot and email notification on AVC denial.
During my F13 repository setup, I had to turn on a few SELinux booleans in order for HG to successfully serve my repositories. Apache was spitting out forbidden errors, and I suspected SELinux as the culprit.</description>

      <title>Drive Backup Over SSH With GZip Compression</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to configure your Linux machine and can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose it, try creating an image of it using dd periodically.
It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense to store the image of the drive on the drive itself, but luckily dd is smart and you can combine it with ssh and gzip to store your stuff off-site.
# dd if=/dev/sda | ssh user@backup.remotehost.com dd of=/backup/drive.img.gz  At this point the drive.</description>

      <description>So I was looking through my httpd access_log files and this popped up every couple of days:
