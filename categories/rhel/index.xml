      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently installed setroubleshoot-server on my RHEL6 server to help diagnose various SELinux denials as I attempt to secure the box.
SETroubleshoot also has an email notification system that is really easy to implement. There are a couple of things that you should consider before going forward.
Add the recipient email addresses to /var/lib/setroubleshoot/email_alert_recipients:
admin@example.com filter_type=after_first  Note: the after_first filter will prevent setroubleshoot from flooding your inbox with the same alert.</description>

      <description>I am planning on using RHEL6 as a web server, primarily for my Mercurial/GIT repositories. This was to replace my current Fedora13 instance. After the initial minimal install, there were a couple of things missing. Mainly setroubleshoot and email notification on AVC denial.
During my F13 repository setup, I had to turn on a few SELinux booleans in order for HG to successfully serve my repositories. Apache was spitting out forbidden errors, and I suspected SELinux as the culprit.</description>
